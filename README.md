# A fancier camera roll

A fancier camera roll is my first ever fullstack application. The purpose of this project is to develop a photography portfolio to display some of my proudest pieces. As of now, the site is being remodelled to implement an ecommerce feature with secure transactions, carts, and products. The most recent deployment can be accessed at https://radiant-chamber-14749.herokuapp.com/ .

### Set up

First, make sure you have Python3 installed. 
Next, you can open up the repository by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbvora03/photos.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
If you don't already have a virtual environment, you can start one using the following commands: 

```
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

Now that you have your virtual environment set up, `cd` into the `photoportfolio` directory and start the server using this command: 

```
python manage.py runserver
